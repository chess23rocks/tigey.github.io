      <h3>Ingredients | Serves 8</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>2 (14-oz) cans sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 (12-oz) cans evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla essence</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit</li>

            For the caramel: In a saucepan, heat the sugar over medium-high heat, stirring until it melts and forms a liquid caramel, about 15 minutes.  It should have a beautiful golden color, but not too dark because the caramel will become bitter.  Pour into a 10-inch round baking pan, covering the bottom and sides of the pan with the caramel.  You have to move quickly to complete this, but be very careful when working with hot caramel because you can burn yourself easily.  Let cool.
            In a blender, process condensed and evaporated milks, 1 cup water, eggs, and vanilla essence.  Pour into the baking pan and place the baking pan over a larger pan filled with an inch of hot water.  Bake for 1 hour.  Take out of the oven, put the pan with the flan on a cooling rack, and let cool.

            To unmold, run a knife around the edge of the pan and turn upside down over a bigger plate.  The caramel will form a pool of sauce on the plate.  Serve this sauce over the dessert.  Keep refrigerated.

        <p>
            Can substitute almond extract for vanilla essence for an almond flavor instead of a vanilla flavor<br>
            If you don't have sweetened condensed milk, then use evaporated milk plus extra sugar (1 can sweetened condensed milk is equal to 1 can evaporated milk plus 1 and 1/4 cups of sugar)
